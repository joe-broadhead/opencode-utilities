## [0.0.0] - 2026-11-01

### Added

- Twenty-five tools under `utilities_<name>`: status, ten time tools, five polled timer tools, six Open-Meteo weather tools, and speech cleanup, transcription and synthesis.
- Time, date, holiday (offline, 2000–2030) and business-day tools. Business days skip a given country's public holidays.
- Project timers that the model checks with `utilities_timer_check`; they never fire on their own.
- Open-Meteo weather with `Weather data by Open-Meteo.com (CC BY 4.0)` on every result, and an optional commercial key: run `/connect` and choose Open-Meteo.
- Speech cleanup with fixed text rules, with no download.
- On-device transcription (Whisper tiny) and synthesis (Kitten TTS). The engine and models download on first use from this repository's GitHub Release after a prompt (`utilities_speech_download`), verified by SHA-256, or are pre-seeded from `speech.assetsDir`. Synthesis writes a WAV file and returns its path.
- Time and weather programs in per-platform optional packages for `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-x64-gnu` and `linux-arm64-gnu`.
- Default ask rules for weather, timer changes, synthesis and the speech download, inserted after each agent's base allow rule. Your rules and saved approvals override them.
- `/utilities` status dialog (palette "Utilities: Status"), `/utilities-status`, `/utilities-speech-install`, the `utilities_status` tool and one RPC method, `status`.
- A startup check for OpenCode `>=2.2.3 <2.3.0`, with `allowUntestedHost` to override it.
